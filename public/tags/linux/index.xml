      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;ndash; Back&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A few weeks back, I worked on a small password generation program that was made using C. I have tried working with C in the past, but this was the first time that I would say I have completed a project at a decent point of completion. I plan to add features in the future, but I want to write about it right now to expain ZZ&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;ndash; Back&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-experience-using-vim&#34;&gt;My Experience Using Vim&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Around the start of June, I went through the trouble of installing Artix Linux on a laptop. With this, I had the choice of what text editor I could install onto my system. In the past, I have never really done any true programming work or config editing on my previous desktop Linux Mint machine. In the occasion that I did, however, I must have used a default text editor like xed. This style of usage really discouraged any sort of terminal work, which would be suited to using vim. I must have heard about vim in the past, and heard about its efficiency when working and its keyboard centric control. So, I installed vim and began my learning process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
