      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;ndash; Back&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I always wanted to read &lt;em&gt;My Ántonia&lt;/em&gt;. Not because I was aware of the story, but because of the cover. My paperback copy is this small, reddish-maroon book with WPA-Era art adorning the cover. The overall look of this book made me think that this book would be interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If I could describe this book in very broad terms, I would say it is a coming of age story of a young man who grows up in Nebraska and how that childhood shapes the person he is. The book being titled &lt;em&gt;My Ántonia&lt;/em&gt; is in reference to a bohemian girl named Ántonia who grows up in parallel with the main character, Jim Burden.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Catcher in the Rye Review</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;ndash; Back&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you have never read &amp;ldquo;The Catcher in the Rye&amp;rdquo; before, one may think that the book is a sophisticated piece of fiction that should be classified in the same category as celebrated 19th century&#xA;stories. It should surely be a difficult to read yet highly insightful body of work. Even if not everyone thinks these things, it is certainly what I thought when I first decided to read&#xA;&amp;ldquo;The Catcher in the Rye&amp;rdquo;. However, my preassumed opinions of the book were quickly ruined when the very first paragraph was written as a teenager complaining. This guy was complaining about his&#xA;parents being &amp;ldquo;touchy as hell&amp;rdquo; and his brother being a supposed prostitute.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
