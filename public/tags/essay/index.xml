      <description>&amp;lt;&amp;ndash; Back&#xA;I always wanted to read My Ántonia. Not because I was aware of the story, but because of the cover. My paperback copy is this small, reddish-maroon book with WPA-Era art adorning the cover. The overall look of this book made me think that this book would be interesting.&#xA;If I could describe this book in very broad terms, I would say it is a coming of age story of a young man who grows up in Nebraska and how that childhood shapes the person he is.</description>

      <description>&amp;lt;&amp;ndash; Back&#xA;If you have never read &amp;ldquo;The Catcher in the Rye&amp;rdquo; before, one may think that the book is a sophisticated piece of fiction that should be classified in the same category as celebrated 19th century stories. It should surely be a difficult to read yet highly insightful body of work. Even if not everyone thinks these things, it is certainly what I thought when I first decided to read &amp;ldquo;The Catcher in the Rye&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>&amp;lt;&amp;ndash; Back&#xA;This is a essay that I wrote for school. It is pretty long &amp;amp; wordy some of the stuff I do not totally agree with, and it assumes things through a secular world view. Its main purpose being here is to see what a large amount of text will look like on this website.&#xA;An Argument for Extraterrestrial’s Existence Throughout generations of humanity, the desire to find out if our life-rich planet is alone has been strong.</description>
