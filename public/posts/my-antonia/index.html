  <p><strong><a href="http://localhost:1313/posts/">&lt;&ndash; Back</a></strong></p>
<p>I always wanted to read <em>My Ántonia</em>. Not because I was aware of the story, but because of the cover. My paperback copy is this small, reddish-maroon book with WPA-Era art adorning the cover. The overall look of this book made me think that this book would be interesting.</p>
<p>If I could describe this book in very broad terms, I would say it is a coming of age story of a young man who grows up in Nebraska and how that childhood shapes the person he is. The book being titled <em>My Ántonia</em> is in reference to a bohemian girl named Ántonia who grows up in parallel with the main character, Jim Burden.</p>
<p>I would say that the author, Willa Cather, excels especially at her ability to describe landscapes. The book is filled with very beautiful descriptions of the scenery that surrounds the events of the book. This beauty contrasts the often demanding work that Ántonia must go through. She works in the fields day after day and grows up to be a very tough and admirable woman.</p>
<p>The book also gives a glimpse into the lives of 1800s settlers, showing the struggles and joys of the era. I always find it fascinating to read about different time periods in American history. The sense of homesickness looms over this book in a very moving way. I cannot help but feel bad for <em>Ántonia&rsquo;s</em> family who work so hard to get by, but yet have so much respect for them.</p>
<p><em>My Ántonia</em> is a short book: around 260 pages. I think this is to its benefit. The story is often pretty dry and I don&rsquo;t think I could personally sit through more than 400 pages of this story. The book does not necessarily have a central conflict that needs to be overcome, but doesn&rsquo;t become a list of diary entries like Jack Kerouac&rsquo;s <em>On the Road</em> becomes.</p>
<p>As an easy to read yet enjoyable book, I would recommend reading <em>My Ántonia</em>. With likable characters, saddening yet moving moments, and some excellent descriptions, it is a book that really drew me in and will do the same for others.</p>
