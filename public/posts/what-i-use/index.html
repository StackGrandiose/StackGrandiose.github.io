  <p><strong><a href="http://localhost:1313/posts/">&lt;&ndash; Back</a></strong></p>
<p>What I use is pretty standard in the realm of linux. To give some context, I am a novice programmer who enjoys learning about software but whose livelihood does not depend on using development tools. I prefer using terminal-based programs, but I also don&rsquo;t believe that GUI programs are objectively horrible. I mostly need a working operating system where I can do typical computing tasks. If you&rsquo;re reading this, chances are you probably know about all of these programs already and reading on is a waste of time.</p>
<h2 id="artix-linux">Artix Linux</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve only seriously used three distributions: <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/">Raspbian</a>, <a href="https://www.linuxmint.com/">Linux Mint</a>, and <a href="https://artixlinux.org/">Artix Linux</a>. I also have a machine that runs Debian, but I almost never use it. Raspbian is understandably slow considering that it must run on a Raspberry Pi. Linux Mint is a really good choice, but I prefer Artix Linux just because of how minimal it is. I definitely couldn&rsquo;t have jumped right into Artix without first using Linux Mint.</p>
<p>I used have used Artix in the past by installing a <a href="https://artixlinux.org/download.php">graphical installation image</a>, which is such a nice thing. It is essentially Arch Linux with the simple installation of Linux Mint, albeit with unnecessary packages and programs you might not use. I am currently using Artix Linux with the base ISO image, which has its downsides but I have now gotten it up to a point of a graphical installation ISO. Artix doesn&rsquo;t get in your way and is probably what I&rsquo;ll be using for a while.</p>
<h2 id="dwm">dwm</h2>
<p><a href="https://dwm.suckless.org/">Dwm (Dynamic Window Manager)</a> is a tiling window manager that initially gives you little but can be set up to become an invaluable piece of software. I have used i3 and awesomewm before, but dwm has been my favorite.</p>
<h2 id="st">st</h2>
<p>Honestly, being particular about a terminal seems pretty stupid. From my limited point of view as a Linux layman, they all practically do the same thing with some minor strengths and weaknesses. I use <a href="https://st.suckless.org/">St (Simple Terminal)</a>, which is very similar to dwm (another suckless program) in that it also doesn&rsquo;t give much up front. Configuring and rebuilding the program is a cornerstone of suckless software. <a href="https://alacritty.org/">Alacritty</a> is another terminal emulator that is technically less lightweight than st, but modern computers seem to run them all the same.</p>
<p>Both dwm and st are great pieces of software, but they just need work to set up. I have configured them before from the base-up with patches and such, but I have discovered that using pre-configured versions is a much more efficient use of time. I currently use <a href="https://github.com/siduck/chadwm">chadwm</a> and Luke Smith&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/st">st</a> build.</p>
<h2 id="neovim">Neovim</h2>
<p>Vim is great. It isn&rsquo;t that hard to learn and definitely beats any other GUI text editor for me. <a href="https://neovim.io/">Neovim</a> seems to be preferred over <a href="https://www.vim.org/">vim</a> which is preferred over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi_(text_editor)">vi</a>. I&rsquo;ve talked about <a href="http://localhost:1313/posts/vim/">vim in a previous post</a>, which has more information.</p>
<h2 id="gnome-pomodoro">Gnome Pomodoro</h2>
<p>Using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">pomodoro technique</a> has proved to be useful in getting stuff done that I&rsquo;d rather not be doing. <a href="https://gnomepomodoro.org/">Gnome Pomodoro</a> is probably as straightforward of a timer as you can get. In the future, I want to either find/code a simple pomodoro timer for the terminal or buy a physical timer and track my sessions in a notebook.</p>
<h2 id="librewolf">Librewolf</h2>
<p><a href="https://librewolf.net/">Librewolf</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ungoogled-software/ungoogled-chromium">Ungoogled Chromium</a> are privacy-centered versions of their respective browsers. I&rsquo;ve used both but now use Librewolf.</p>
<h2 id="obsidian">Obsidian</h2>
<p><a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> is closed source, but how it keeps notes in Markdown gives me confidence that I would be able to move away from it if it were to become more intrusive. Before using Obsidian, I never really kept digital notes. Now, I have a scattered collection of notes that makes it useful to refer back to past information.</p>
<h2 id="nitrogen">Nitrogen</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/l3ib/nitrogen/">Nitrogen</a> is a great wallpaper setter. <a href="https://feh.finalrewind.org/">Feh</a> can also set the background in a more minimal way, but nitrogen just makes it easier to keep a collection of wallpapers.</p>
<h2 id="zathura">Zathura</h2>
<p><a href="https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/">Zathura</a> is a great pdf viewer. I&rsquo;ve found that <a href="https://wiki.mate-desktop.org/mate-desktop/applications/atril/">Atril</a> works better on very large pdf files, but Zathura is more to the point. It uses vim-style keybinds and has little in terms of user interface.</p>
<h2 id="calibre">Calibre</h2>
<p><a href="https://calibre-ebook.com/">Calibre</a> is pretty bloated, but it performs its purpose well: managing ebooks. It makes organizing ebooks, fetching book covers, and transferring books onto e-readers easier.</p>
