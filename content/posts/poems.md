>>The ground sits, hardened into hills and flat lands for life to be.
>>
>>Light darkens, bringing way to humble crystals that coat dull earth.
>>
>>Light brightens. Its return holds true, and our new friend will leave soon.

>>The world sat  in a firm state,  slowly changing without a voice
>>
>>Against choice, This silent change turns into coarse yet forced actions
>>
>>Hope is for a new paradigm, yet these things start without stop

-

>>A safe, quaint vernal pool
>>
>>A sea for miniscule creatures
>>
>>A bird hopping, waiting for warmth
>>
>>The wind blowing through the bare trees
>>
>>Bare trees
>>
>>Dead leaves
>>
>>Green spring upon us
