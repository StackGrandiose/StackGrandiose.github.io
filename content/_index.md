Welcome to StackGrandiose.github.io. This is currently my personal
website. It has gone through many iterations. The color scheme this site
uses is [Flexoki](https://stephango.com/flexoki) by Steph Ango.

Mainly used as an alternative to social media, I hope this website will become a place where I can share my thoughts and projects. Currently, the things you can see on my profile include:

- Essays
- Open-Source adjacent things
- Ceramics
- Pottery
- Scale Models
- Photography (Soon)
- etc.

These passions of mine fluctuate in intensity, but I'll try to update this blog/personal site as much as I can to whomever this may interest. Thanks.
