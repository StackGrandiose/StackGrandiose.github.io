Welcome to StackGrandiose.github.io. This is currently my personal
website. It has gone through many iterations, with this current form being its most recent. The color scheme this site
uses is [Flexoki](https://stephango.com/flexoki), which is available in both light and dark mode.

Mainly used as an alternative to social media, I hope this website will become a place where I can share my thoughts and projects. You'll see stuff relating to programming, reading, health(?) and pottery here. Everything put out on this site is a product of my own judgment and opinion, so please be skeptical of everything on here.

This website is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/). I plan on buying a domain and hosting this website either locally or using a VPS, but for now this website is hosted on GitHub.
